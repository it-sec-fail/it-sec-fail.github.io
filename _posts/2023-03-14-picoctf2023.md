## PicoCTF

Today the PicoCTF will start. It is a good CTF to start with, because it has some educational background. There are quite a few beginnertasks and some of the "how should I solve this one"-kind. We'll join the PicoCTF. 

Registration Open: 6:00pm GMT+1 Feb 1, 2023
Competition Start: Mar 14,2023
Competition End: 9:00pm GMT+2 Mar 28, 2023
