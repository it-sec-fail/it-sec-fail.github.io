## RushCTF

On saturday we started with the RUSHCTF 2022 and it was quite fun!
Smilymarco, Mr81u35ky and myself tried to solve all the challenges... but after such a long time not doing CTFs we struggled on some of the tasks.
Okay, to be honest with you guys... we never solve all challenges but event the warmup and easy challenges were quite hard :-D.

But we'll do more CTF in the future!
