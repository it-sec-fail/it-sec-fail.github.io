# New blog

We'll try to get things a littlebit easier for us and the first step is to generate the homepage with `jekyll` and a minimal theme.
I'll hope, that we then could just maintain our repo on github and all the other things will then be done automatically.

Let's see how this will work out ðŸ˜Š
