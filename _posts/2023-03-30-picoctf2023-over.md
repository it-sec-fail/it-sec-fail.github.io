## PicoCTF 2023 is over

This week the picoCTF 2023 ended and we were there again.
Place 485 of 6924... what a result, what a journey and how much fun was that please. Again we sat with partly 6 people in the Discord and have exchanged us to the challenges. We dared again to some challenges which were absolutely new for us... (Unity Game Hacking) and the feeling, if you cracked the task in the team, is not to be compared with the Dopaminaussto√ü of TikTok üòâ

Thanks to Mr81u35ky, Smileymarco, Liquid, TreeNode and FarbzeN for this fun and great time! I'm looking forward to the next event, which is already planned üòÅ
